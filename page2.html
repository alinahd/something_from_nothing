    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="text">I'm getting really fond of the room in spite of the wallpaper.</h1>
        <h2 class="text">Perhaps because of the wallpaper.</h2>
        <h3 class="text">It dwells in my mind so!</h3>
        <p class="text">I lie here on this great immovable bed – it is nailed down, I believe – and follow that pattern about by the hour.</p>
        <h1 class="text">I will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a conclusion.</h1>
        <h2 class="text">I know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was not arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition, or symmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.</h2>
        <h3 class="text">It is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise.</h3>
        <p class="text">Looked at in one way each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and flourishes—a kind of "debased Romanesque" with delirium tremens—go waddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity.</p>
        <h1 class="text">But, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot of wallowing seaweeds in full chase.</h1>
        <h2 class="text">The whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I exhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that direction.</h2>
        <h3 class="text">They have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds wonderfully to the confusion.</h3>
        <p class="text">There is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when the crosslights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can almost fancy radiation after all.</p>
