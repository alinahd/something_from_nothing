    <p>There are things in that paper that nobody knows <br> but me, <span class="text1">or ever will</span></p> 
    
    <p>Behind that outside pattern the dim <br> shapes get <span class="text2">clearer every day.</span>
    <br>It is always the same shape, <span class="text3"> only</span>
    <br>very numerous. And it is <br>like a woman stooping down <span class="text4"> creeping about that pattern</span></p>
    
    <br>
    <p>I don't like it <span class="text5"> a bit</span> 
    <br> I wish John would <span class="text6"> take me away </span> <br> <span class="text7">from here !</span> <br> John was asleep and I hated <br>to waken him, so I kept 
    <br> still and <span class="text8"> watched the </span> <br> undulating <span class="text9"> wallpaper</span> <br> till <span class="text10"> I felt creepy</span></p>
    
    <br> 
    <p>The faint figure behind seemed <br>to shake the pattern, just as if <br> she wanted to <br> <span class="text11"> get out</p>
    <p> It is so puzzling. <br><span class="text12"> It keeps me quiet by the hour.</span>
    <br> The women behind the paper is all the time <br> trying to climb through. <span class="text13">But nobody could climb through that pattern.</span></p>
    <br>
    <p>it <span class="text14"> I think that is why it has</span><br> strangles <span class="text15"> so</span> <span class="text17"> heads</span><br>so<span class="text16"> many</span></p>
